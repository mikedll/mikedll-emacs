These are some sample emacs config files I use on a daily basis, and
also that I use to give emacs tutorials. The most interesting is
probably emacs-extensions, which I've used to drive Clojure and Ruby
REPL-interpretters.
      
The Windows help also shows how to capture the Win key, or how to mess
with windows services from emacs (makes shell calls to the sc command
line tool).
